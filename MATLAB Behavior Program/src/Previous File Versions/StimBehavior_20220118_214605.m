function count = cprintf(style,format,varargin)
% CPRINTF displays styled formatted text in the Command Window
%
% Syntax:
%    count = cprintf(style,format,...)
%
% Description:
%    CPRINTF processes the specified text using the exact same FORMAT
%    arguments accepted by the built-in SPRINTF and FPRINTF functions.
%
%    CPRINTF then displays the text in the Command Window using the
%    specified STYLE argument. The accepted styles are those used for
%    Matlab's syntax highlighting (see: File / Preferences / Colors / 
%    M-file Syntax Highlighting Colors), and also user-defined colors.
%
%    The possible pre-defined STYLE names are:
%
%       'Text'                 - default: black
%       'Keywords'             - default: blue
%       'Comments'             - default: green
%       'Strings'              - default: purple
%       'UnterminatedStrings'  - default: dark red
%       'SystemCommands'       - default: orange
%       'Errors'               - default: light red
%       'Hyperlinks'           - default: underlined blue
%
%       'Black','Cyan','Magenta','Blue','Green','Red','Yellow','White'
%
%    STYLE beginning with '-' or '_' will be underlined. For example:
%          '-Blue' is underlined blue, like 'Hyperlinks';
%          '_Comments' is underlined green etc.
%
%    STYLE beginning with '*' will be bold (R2011b+ only). For example:
%          '*Blue' is bold blue;
%          '*Comments' is bold green etc.
%    Note: Matlab does not currently support both bold and underline,
%          only one of them can be used in a single cprintf command. But of
%          course bold and underline can be mixed by using separate commands.
%
%    STYLE also accepts a regular Matlab RGB vector, that can be underlined
%    and bolded: -[0,1,1] means underlined cyan, '*[1,0,0]' is bold red.
%
%    STYLE is case-insensitive and accepts unique partial strings just
%    like handle property names.
%
%    CPRINTF by itself, without any input parameters, displays a demo
%
% Example:
%    cprintf;   % displays the demo
%    cprintf('text',   'regular black text');
%    cprintf('hyper',  'followed %s','by');
%    cprintf('key',    '%d colored', 4);
%    cprintf('-comment','& underlined');
%    cprintf('err',    'elements\n');
%    cprintf('cyan',   'cyan');
%    cprintf('_green', 'underlined green');
%    cprintf(-[1,0,1], 'underlined magenta');
%    cprintf([1,0.5,0],'and multi-\nline orange\n');
%    cprintf('*blue',  'and *bold* (R2011b+ only)\n');
%    cprintf('string');  % same as fprintf('string') and cprintf('text','string')
%
% Bugs and suggestions:
%    Please send to Yair Altman (altmany at gmail dot com)
%
% Warning:
%    This code heavily relies on undocumented and unsupported Matlab
%    functionality. It works on Matlab 7+, but use at your own risk!
%
%    A technical description of the implementation can be found at:
%    <a href="http://undocumentedmatlab.com/blog/cprintf/">http://UndocumentedMatlab.com/blog/cprintf/</a>
%
% Limitations:
%    1. In R2011a and earlier, a single space char is inserted at the
%       beginning of each CPRINTF text segment (this is ok in R2011b+).
%
%    2. In R2011a and earlier, consecutive differently-colored multi-line
%       CPRINTFs sometimes display incorrectly on the bottom line.
%       As far as I could tell this is due to a Matlab bug. Examples:
%         >> cprintf('-str','under\nline'); cprintf('err','red\n'); % hidden 'red', unhidden '_'
%         >> cprintf('str','regu\nlar'); cprintf('err','red\n'); % underline red (not purple) 'lar'
%
%    3. Sometimes, non newline ('\n')-terminated segments display unstyled
%       (black) when the command prompt chevron ('>>') regains focus on the
%       continuation of that line (I can't pinpoint when this happens). 
%       To fix this, simply newline-terminate all command-prompt messages.
%
%    4. In R2011b and later, the above errors appear to be fixed. However,
%       the last character of an underlined segment is not underlined for
%       some unknown reason (add an extra space character to make it look better)
%
%    5. In old Matlab versions (e.g., Matlab 7.1 R14), multi-line styles
%       only affect the first line. Single-line styles work as expected.
%       R14 also appends a single space after underlined segments.
%
%    6. Bold style is only supported on R2011b+, and cannot also be underlined.
%
% Change log:
%    2012-08-09: Graceful degradation support for deployed (compiled) and non-desktop applications; minor bug fixes
%    2012-08-06: Fixes for R2012b; added bold style; accept RGB string (non-numeric) style
%    2011-11-27: Fixes for R2011b
%    2011-08-29: Fix by Danilo (FEX comment) for non-default text colors
%    2011-03-04: Performance improvement
%    2010-06-27: Fix for R2010a/b; fixed edge case reported by Sharron; CPRINTF with no args runs the demo
%    2009-09-28: Fixed edge-case problem reported by Swagat K
%    2009-05-28: corrected nargout behavior sugegsted by Andreas Gäb
%    2009-05-13: First version posted on <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/authors/27420">MathWorks File Exchange</a>

%   Connect_MotoTrak establishes the serial connection between the computer

%   UPDATE LOG:
%   05/09/2016 - Drew Sloan - Separated serial functions from the
