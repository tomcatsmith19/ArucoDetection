%Read_Google_Spreadsheet.m - Rennaker Lab, 2010
%
%   Read_Google_Spreadsheet reads in spreadsheet data from Google Documents
%   spreadsheets and returns the data as a 2-D cell array.  To use this
%   function, you must first publish the document as a webpage with Plain
%   Text (TXT) formatting.
%
%   data = Read_Google_Spreadsheet(url) reads the spreadsheet data from the
%   Google Document link specified by "url" and returns it in the cell
%   array "data".
%   
%   UPDATE LOG:
%   07/07/2014 - Drew Sloan - Removed string-formating checks to work
%       around Google Docs updates.
%   07/06/2016 - Drew Sloan - Replaced "urlread" with "webread" when the
%       function is run on MATLAB versions 2014b+.
